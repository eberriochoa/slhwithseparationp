# slhwithseparationp
This repositoy is linked to the piece of work  "A type of interpolation between those of Lagrange and Hermite that uses nodal systems satisfying some separation properties"

You can find the eps files included in the text, see branch named graphs.

You can obtain the source code (Mathematica 12.2) used to obtain the previous graphs, see branch named sourcecode .

root1, root2, root3 and root4 are essentially the same program, they only differ in the .wls file used to construct the nodal system.

The other .wls files are pieces of code that construct de different objects of the corresponding formulae.
